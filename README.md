  <h1>Tippy.js for React v19</h1>
</div>

[Tippy.js](https://github.com/VladimirAntin/tippyjs-react) is the complete tooltip,
popover, dropdown, and menu solution for the web, powered by Popper.

Tippy is an abstraction over Popper that provides common logic involved in all
types of elements that pop out on top of the UI, positioned next to a target or
reference element. This is a React wrapper for the core library, providing full
integration including headless rendering abilities.
